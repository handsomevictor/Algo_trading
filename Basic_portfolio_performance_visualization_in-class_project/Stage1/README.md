Stage1

Run the final_function_assembly.py, and use the function: investor_please_input() to type in the things needed, and after all information are processed, use graph1() to graph5() to see the interactive html graphs which will show the portfolio and individual stocks' performance from 5 different perspectives.

graph1: To compare YTD (year to date, the return rate of buying the stock at the beginning of this year and selling it now) returns of investor's stocks and S&P 500

graph2: Current share price versus closing high (the highest price) since purchased, which can show if this investor is good at selling his stocks at the best time (stupid, but apparent)

graph3: Total return comparison charts

graph4: Cumulative returns over time

graph5: Total cumulative investment over time
